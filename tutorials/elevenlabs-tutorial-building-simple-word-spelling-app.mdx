## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of software development, generative AI tools are making waves. From generating cover letters and emails to automatically commenting on code, these tools are revolutionizing the way we work. They're not just limited to text, either - with the latest image generation models, we can now generate images from text prompts, opening up a world of possibilities for incorporating generated assets into our products.

But what about voices? With the rise of voice command as a key trend in user experience, it's clear that the software we build needs to incorporate voices as a feature. That's where speech synthesis comes in. As a form of generative AI, speech synthesis allows us to generate spoken language by machine, making it a powerful tool for enhancing user experience.

In this tutorial, we'll explore the potential of speech synthesis by building a simple app that generates random words and spells them out. We'll be using the Speech Synthesis feature offered by ElevenLabs, a cutting-edge platform for building and deploying machine learning models. To build the user interface for our Python-based app, we'll use Streamlit, a new UI library that makes it easy to share data science projects.

Whether you're a beginner looking to dip your toes into the world of AI and speech synthesis, or an experienced developer eager to incorporate new tools into your projects, this tutorial has something for you. Let's get started!

### Introduction to ElevenLabs

ElevenLabs is a leading voice technology research company that offers a powerful speech synthesis solution. With an easy-to-use API, ElevenLabs allows developers to generate high-quality speeches using AI. This is made possible by an AI model that has been extensively trained on a vast amount of audiobooks and podcasts. This extensive training enables the AI to generate a wide range of voices and speech styles, ensuring high-quality and predictable results.

ElevenLabs offers two main features. The first is VoiceLab, a tool that allows users to clone voices from recorded audio or existing pre-made voices. Users can also "design" voices based on gender, age, ethnicity, and race, allowing for a high degree of customization. Once users have created or selected their voices, they can move on to the second feature, Speech Synthesis. This tool allows users to generate speeches using their custom-designed voices or the pre-made ones.

By offering these features, ElevenLabs makes it easy for developers to incorporate high-quality, customizable speech synthesis into their applications. Whether you're looking to enhance a language learning app, create a voice assistant, or add voice features to a game, ElevenLabs provides the tools you need to make it happen.

### Introduction to Anthropic's Claude Model

Claude is the latest AI model developed by Anthropic, a research organization focused on enhancing the ability of artificial intelligence systems to work together (interoperability), as well as their robustness and safety. The Claude model is designed to generate human-like responses, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, from content creation to legal services and customer support.

Like many AI models, Claude is trained on a diverse range of internet text, including books, articles, and websites. This extensive training allows it to generate a wide variety of responses, making it adaptable to many different contexts and uses.

However, what sets Claude apart from most AI models is its focus on safety. The model has been designed to refuse to generate outputs that it predicts the user will find harmful or untruthful. This feature makes Claude a safer and more reliable choice for developers looking to integrate AI into their applications, as it helps to prevent the dissemination of harmful or misleading information.

### Introduction to Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that empowers developers and data scientists to create and share visually appealing, customized web apps for data science projects. With Streamlit, you can build and deploy fully-featured, data-driven web applications in just a few minutes.

Streamlit's simple and intuitive API allows you to turn data scripts into interactive UI components. It supports a wide range of widgets for user input, including sliders, text inputs, and buttons, making it easy to create interactive, user-friendly applications.

In addition to its ease of use, Streamlit also offers robust functionality. It includes features for caching, theming, and custom components, allowing you to create complex applications with minimal code. Whether you're creating a simple data visualization or a complex machine learning tool, Streamlit provides the tools you need to bring your project to life.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python and UI development using Streamlit
- Access to Anthropic API
- Access to ElevenLabs API

### Outline

1. Initializing our Streamlit Project
2. Adding Word Generation Feature using Claude Model
3. Adding Speech Generation Feature using ElevenLabs API
4. Testing the Word Generator App

## Discussion

There are at least four steps that we will get through in this tutorial. First we need to initialize the Streamlit-based project, to get a general feel of developing user interfaces using Streamlit. Next, we start adding more features, beginning with engineering prompt to get Claude model to give us a randomized word that is commonly misspelled. After that, we'll add text-to-voice generation provided by ElevenLabs to demonstrate how the multilingual model spell the words. Finally, we're going to test the simple app.

### Initializing our Streamlit Project

Let's get into the coding action! First, let's make a directory for our project and enter it!

```bash
mkdir randomwords
cd randomwords
```
Next, we're going to use this directory as the basis of our Streamlit project. Because a Streamlit project is essentially a Python project, we need to do some steps to initialize our Python project, such as defining and activating our virtual environment.

```bash
# Creating the virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac
source env/bin/activate

# On Windows:
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
Once activated, the output of our terminal should show the name of the virtual environment (env), like so:

<Img src="https://iili.io/HimUlYG.png" alt="the terminal should show the name of our virtual environment, indicating that the virtual environment is activated" />

Next, it's time to install the libraries we need for this project! let's use the `pip` command to install the `streamlit`, `anthropic`, and `elevenlabs` library. Note that we also install a version-locked `pydantic` library to prevent a Pydantic-related error in one of the `elevenlabs` function.

```bash
pip install streamlit anthropic elevenlabs "pydantic==1.*"
```
With all the project's requirements out of the way, now let's dive into the coding part! Create a new file inside our project directory, let's call it `randomwords_app.py`.

```bash
touch randomwords_app.py
```
After the file is created, let's open the file in our favorite code editor or integrated development environment (IDE). For the starter, let's build our simple app from the simplest parts possible, a title and a text for the caption!

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Random Words Generator")

st.text("Hello, this is a random words generator app")
```
To wrap up our project initialization part, let's try test running the app. Make sure that our current working directory is still inside our project and our virtual environment is already activated. When everything is ready, use the `streamlit run <app-name>` to run the app.

```bash
streamlit run randomwords_app.py
```

The app should open automatically in our default browsers! it should show the title and text for now. Next, we're going to add random word generation feature using Anthropic's Claude model.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HimU0vf.png" alt="the app should show the title (Random Words Generator) and text (Hello, this is a random words generator app)" />

One last thing though, we'll have to provide our app with the API keys for the services that we're going to use, namely Anthropic's Claude model and ElevenLabs' Speech Synthesis feature. As these keys are considered sensitive, we should keep them in a safe and isolated place. 

However, this time we don't store them in a `.env` file. This is because Streamlit deal with environment variables differently. According to the [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/secrets-management), we need to create a secret configuration file inside a `.streamlit` directory. We can create the directory inside our project and then create the file.

```bash
mkdir .streamlit
touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
```
Let's edit the TOML file we created, note that TOML file uses different formatting from the usual `.env` file.

```toml
xi_api_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
claude_key = "sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### Adding Word Generation Feature using Claude Model

In this step, we will add a button that will generate the random word, the heading element to show the generated word and the subheading to show the meaning of the word. However, coming from a webdev background, I strongly believe that UI elements should be placed and arranged inside containers. So, we'll do exactly that.

#### Import the necessary libraries

First of all, let's add some import statements. We're going to import the `anthropic` library to generate our random words.

```python
import streamlit as st
import anthropic
```
Then, before we get to the UI part, let's create our word generation function first.

#### Defining the word generation function

```python
def generate_word():
    prompt = (f"{anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT} Give me one non-English word that's commonly misspelled and the meaning. Please strictly follow the format! example: Word: Schadenfreude; Meaning: joy at other's expenses."
              f"{anthropic.AI_PROMPT} Word: Karaoke; Meaning: a form of entertainment where people sing popular songs over pre-recorded backing tracks."
              f"{anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT} Great! just like that. Remember, only respond following the pattern.")

    c = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=st.secrets["claude_key"])
    resp = c.completions.create(
        prompt=f"{prompt} {anthropic.AI_PROMPT}",
        stop_sequences=[anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT],
        model="claude-v1.3-100k",
        max_tokens_to_sample=900,
    )

    print(resp.completion)
    return resp.completion
```
In this function, the most heavy lifting is done by Anthropic's Claude model (Thanks, Claude! 😉). However, our part in this function is how to make Claude return the exact format consistently. So we need to both instruct Claude to "strictly follow the format" and give it an example response by adding it after our initial prompt. Finally, we make sure that Claude comply with our agreements by ask it to "Remember to only respond following the pattern". The function ends by returning the response from Claude.

Next, let's get back to editing the UI!

#### Updating the UI

```python
st.title("Random Words Generator")

with st.container():
    st.header("Random Word")
    random_word = st.subheader("-")
    word_meaning = st.text("Meaning: -")

    st.write("Click the `Generate` button to generate new word")
    if st.button("Generate"):
        result = generate_word()
        # Split the string on the semicolon
        split_string = result.split(";")

        # Split the first part on ": " to get the word
        word = split_string[0].split(": ")[1]

        # Split the second part on ": " to get the meaning
        meaning = split_string[1].split(": ")[1]

        print(f"word result: {word}")
        random_word.subheader(word)
        word_meaning.text(f"Meaning: {meaning}")
```
This time, we added a container with some elements inside it. The header, subheader for displaying the random word, and the text element to show the meaning of the word. We also have a text to show the hint on how to use the app, as well as a button beneath it.

In Streamlit, we can declare click event handler by using a conditional statement, where it returns `True` when the button is clicked. In this code, we invoke the `generate_word()` function which returns the generated word and the meaning, and split the result into separate variables for the word and the meaning, respectively. Finally, we update the subheader and the text element to display the word and the meaning.

#### Final form

Let's double check our code once again! It should contains the import statements, the function for generating the random word, and the updated UI which contains subheader, and text elements as well as button that generate the word by invoking the `generate_word()` function.

```python
import streamlit as st
import anthropic

def generate_word():
    prompt = (f"{anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT} Give me one non-English word that's commonly misspelled and the meaning. Please strictly follow the format! example: Word: Schadenfreude; Meaning: joy at other's expenses."
              f"{anthropic.AI_PROMPT} Word: Karaoke; Meaning: a form of entertainment where people sing popular songs over pre-recorded backing tracks."
              f"{anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT} Great! just like that. Remember, only respond following the pattern.")

    c = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=st.secrets["claude_key"])
    resp = c.completions.create(
        prompt=f"{prompt} {anthropic.AI_PROMPT}",
        stop_sequences=[anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT],
        model="claude-v1.3-100k",
        max_tokens_to_sample=900,
    )

    print(resp.completion)
    return resp.completion


st.title("Random Words Generator")

with st.container():
    st.header("Random Word")
    random_word = st.subheader("-")
    word_meaning = st.text("Meaning: -")

    st.write("Click the `Generate` button to generate new word")
    if st.button("Generate"):
        result = generate_word()
        # Split the string on the semicolon
        split_string = result.split(";")

        # Split the first part on ": " to get the word
        word = split_string[0].split(": ")[1]

        # Split the second part on ": " to get the meaning
        meaning = split_string[1].split(": ")[1]

        print(f"word result: {word}")
        random_word.subheader(word)
        word_meaning.text(f"Meaning: {meaning}")
```

### Testing the Word Generation Function

Let's run the app once again with the same command. We can also just rerun the app by clicking the upper right menu and click "Rerun" if we've had the app running before.

It should show this updated user interface.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HimU1p4.png" alt="The updated UI of our random words generator app, it has subheader, text elements and button" />

Now, let's try clicking the `Generate` button!

<Img src="https://iili.io/HimUGTl.png" alt="the app shows loading indicator" />

One of the sweet things about Streamlit is that it handled loading and provided the loading indicator out of the box. We should see the indicator in the upper-right corner, as well as the option to "stop" the operation. Neat, huh?

After a few seconds, the result should be showed in the UI.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HimUMj2.png" alt="Our app generated the word 'Gnocchi' for the random word" />

Perfect! notice that the app correctly split the generated text from the Claude model into word and the meaning. However, if the result doesn't come out according to the expected format, we can always click the `Generate` button again.

The next step is the main feature of this app, to incorporate speech generation into our random word generator. Besides demonstrating how to generate the audio file using the API provided by ElevenLabs, this step also serve to demonstrate the capabilities of ElevenLabs' multilingual model.

### Adding Speech Generation Feature using ElevenLabs API

The first step of this section is, as you've probably guessed, is to add more import statement! So, let's add some functions from `elevenlabs` that we'll use for the speech generation feature.

```diff
import streamlit as st
import anthropic
++ from elevenlabs import generate, set_api_key
```
Next, we're going to define the function to handle the speech generation.

```python
def generate_speech(word):
    set_api_key(st.secrets['xi_api_key'])
    audio = generate(
        text=word,
        voice="Bella",
        model='eleven_multilingual_v1'
    )

    return audio
```
Thanks to the simplicity and readability of Python, and also ElevenLabs easy-to-use API, we can generate the speech by using this code alone! The function accepts the random word which we use to generate the speech. We also specifically use "eleven_multilingual_v1" model which is a multilingual model, perfect for our use case to demonstrate the spelling and pronounciation of foreign and commonly misspelled words! Finally, we use the "Bella" voice for this tutorial, which is one of the pre-made voice provided by ElevenLabs.

Next, we'll add an audio player to play the generated speech.

```diff
    print(f"word result: {word}")
    random_word.subheader(word)
    word_meaning.text(f"Meaning: {meaning}")
++     speech = generate_speech(word)
++     st.audio(speech, format='audio/mpeg')
```

Just below our latest code from earlier, we add the variable to store the generated speech, and run the speech using audio player provided by `st.audio` function from Streamlit. At this point, our app should work as expected, only showing the audio player when there is a random word available to "read".

Curious how it works out? me too! let's test the app now!

### Testing the Word Spelling Feature

Let's run the app again using `streamlit run` or just rerun the app if we have it running already. It should look exactly the same as the last time we left it. However, let's try to click the "Generate" button this time!

<Img src="https://iili.io/HimUVQS.png" alt="Our app shows an audio player once a random word is generated" />

Amazing! this time, the app also shows an audio player! Let's try playing it. Using the multilingual model, the speech generated should use the accent and intonation which is close to the origin language of the word. For example, "entrepreneur" should be pronounced in French accent.

## Conclusion

In this short tutorial, hopefully we've explored the capabilities of speech generation technology offered by ElevenLabs. With the multilingual model, it's easy to generate speeches that is intended for non-English listener. In our use case, we need multilingual model to aid us in finding the correct way to pronounce and spell non-English words that are commonly misspelled.

Thank you for joining me in this process of exploring what ElevenLabs has to offer! I hope this tutorial has sparked some inspirations on how we leverage voice generation model such as the ones offered by ElevenLabs, whether monolingual or multilingual, in more interesting and varying use cases. You can find the finished project on my [Github](https://github.com/septiannugraha/randomwords). Stay tuned for more tutorials in the future!
