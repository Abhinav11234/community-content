## Introduction
[Imagen by Vertex AI]() is the powerful text-to-image generation tool that allows us not only to generate images, however edit and analyze them.

**Generating Images** - We can generate images by providing a prompt. For example, we can generate an image of a cat wearing a hat.

**Editing Images** - Here we can edit the generated images or upload a new image and edit it. It allows us to go beyond the generated image and turn on our imagination. 
Like changing the background, adding text description, changing the color of the hat or material, changing the color of the cat or fur, and more.

**Analyzing Images** - We can generate captions for the image, ask questions about the image. 
For example, we can ask what is in the image, what is the color of the hat, what is the material of the hat, mood of the cat, and more.

## Time to Dive In!


I will provide screenshots to make it more convinient and easy to digest. Let's get started!

Let's start with generating images. Click `GENERATE` button. And below in the textarea enter the following prompt:

```

```


Now, click `GENERATE` button:

Full image:

You can generate more images by clicking `GENERATE` button again. You can also edit the image by clicking `EDIT` button. You can change the image, add text, change the background, and more.


### Editing Images

Let's try to edit the image. Click `EDIT` button and turn on your imagination. For now, I will simply extract the background. Feel free to play around `EDIT` feature.

Next, let's ask questions about the image. Click `VISUAL Q&A` button and ask any question you want. I tried the following questions:

```
What is the color of the hat?
```
