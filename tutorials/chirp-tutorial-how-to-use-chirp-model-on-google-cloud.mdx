## Introduction
[Chirp]() is Google Cloud's 2B-parameter speech model built via self-supervised training on millions of hours of audio and [28 billion sentences of text spanning 100+ languages](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/03/universal-speech-model-usm-state-of-art.html). Chirp delivers 98% speech recognition accuracy in English and over 300% relative improvement in several languages with less than 10M speakers. 


## What we are going to do?
In this tutorial, we will learn how to effortlessly set up Google Cloud console to leverage the powerful Chirp speech-to-text AI model. This comprehensive tutorial provides step-by-step guide for an easy setup process and a quick start to use Chirp speech-to-text AI model. Sit back, relax, enjoy the tutorial and don't forget to make a cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è.


### Learning outcomes
- How to use Google Cloud console.
- How to set up Google's Chirp speech-to-text AI model on Google Cloud console.


### We will cover the following steps:

1. Creating a Google Cloud account.
2. Creating a new project on the Google Cloud console.
3. Enabling the Speech API.
4. Creating an STT (Speech-to-Text) Recognizer using the Chirp model.
5. Creating a new Workspace for the project.
6. Performing a transcription on an audio file.
7. Viewing and downloading the transcription results.


### Prerequisites
Nothing! Just a cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è and a laptop üíª.



## Getting started


### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud account

First, we need to create a Google Cloud account. If you already have one, you can skip this step and [go here](https://cloud.google.com/). If you don't have one, you can create a free account [go here](https://cloud.google.com/free).

### Step 2: Create a new project

Next, we need to create a new project. On the top left corner click on the `project dropdown menu` > `New Project`.

<Img src="./images/creatingNewProject.png" alt="Google Cloud console creating new project" caption="Google Cloud console creating new project"/>

Give your project a name and click `Create`.

### Step 3: Enable API

Go to [Speech](https://console.cloud.google.com/speech) in Google Cloud console. Click `ENABLE API`.

<Img src="./images/enableAPI.png" alt="Google Cloud console enable API" caption="Google Cloud console enableAPI"/>


### Step 4: Create an STT Recognizer

Go over left sidebar navigation and click `Recognizers` > `CREATE RECOGNIZERS`. 

Give your recognizer a name `chirp-recognizer`. Select `Chirp` as the model. Select the language `en-US` in our case, leave the rest of the settings as default and click `Save`.

### Step 5: Create a new Workspace

Now, we need to create a new Workspace for our project. Go to `Workspace dropdown menu` and click `New Workspace`. You should see a sidebar pops up on the right side of your screen. 

From the Create a new workspace navigation sidebar, click `Browse` > `Create a new bucket`. Give your bucket a name `chirp-bucket` and click `Continue`.

<Img src="./images/namingNewBucket.png" alt="Google Cloud console naming new Bucket" caption="Google Cloud console naming new Bucket"/>

Note: Rest of the settings are optional, you can leave them as default. 

Click `Create` and you should see a new bucket is created as shown below.

Then, click `Select` > `Continue` > `Create` to finish creating your workspace for the speech-to-text UI.



Perfet! Now, we have a workspace for our speech-to-text UI. Let's move on to the next step.


### Step 6: Create a new Transcription

Let's perform a transcription on our actual audio file. 

<Img src="./images/chirpWorkspace.png" alt="Google Cloud console Chirp Workspace" caption="Google Cloud console Chirp Workspace"/>

Go over left sidebar navigation and click `Transcription` > `New Transcription`. From the `New Transcription` page, select your audio file through either uploading audio files `Local upload` or specifying an existing Cloud Storage file `Cloud storage`. 

In this tutorial, we will use `Local upload` option and [this](./audio/ElevenLabs_2023-05-26T12_34_02.000Z_Adam_FjVs58vot1BUeNaRj635.mp3) audio file.

Note: The UI will assess your audio file parameters automatically, and you can also specify them manually.

Click `Continue`. 

By default API version is set to `V1`, change it to `V2`, specify the language `English (United States) - en-US` in our case spoken in the audio file from the `dropdown menu`, then choose `Chirp` as transcription model and our newly created `chirp-recognizer` as the recognizer.

Click `Submit` and wait for a few seconds.


### Step 7: View Transcription Results and Download

To see the transcription results, click `the name of your transcription`.

<Img src="./images/transcriptionResults.png" alt="Google Cloud console transcription results" caption="Google Cloud console transcription results"/>

You may also download the transcription results in 4 different formats: `JSON`, `TXT`, `SRT`, and `CSV`. Let's download the transcription results in `TXT` format. Click `Download` > `TXT` > `Download.
