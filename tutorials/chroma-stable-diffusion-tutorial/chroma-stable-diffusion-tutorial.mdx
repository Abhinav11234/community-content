## Introduction
[Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/), is the AI-native open-source embedding database. Chroma makes it easy to build LLM apps by making knowledge, facts, and skills pluggable for LLMs [read more...](https://docs.trychroma.com/).
[Cohere](https://cohere.ai/), is a platform that allows you to build AI-powered applications with just a few lines of code. Cohere's API allows you to build a wide range of applications, including chatbots, question answering systems, and summarization tools [read more...](https://cohere.com/embed).
[Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-diffusion), is a new generative model that can generate high-resolution images with a single forward pass.


## What we are going to do?
In this tutorial, 

To make it more clear and understandable, we will split this tutorial into two parts:
- Part 1 - Getting prompt for Stable Diffusion. In this part, we will go through Chroma and Cohere. We will load the document, split it into smaller chunks, embed them using Cohere and then we will use Chroma to query the database and get the prompt for Image Generation.
- Part 2 - Generating images using Stable Diffusion. In this part, we will go through Stable Diffusion SDK and implement the code to generate images based on the prompt we got in Part 1.

### Prerequisites
To use Cohere embeddings we need API key, go to [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/), on the top right corner click `TRY NOW`, login or create an account and copy/save your API key.
To use Stable Diffusion we need API Key, go to [Dream Studio](https://dreamstudio.ai/account), on the top right corner click `GET STARTED`, login or create an account and copy/save your API key.

## Getting started

### Create a new project

Let's start by creating new Notebook in Google Colab.

Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create new Notebook.

<Img src="./images/colabNewNotebook.png" alt="Creating new Notebook in Google Colab" caption="Creating new Notebook in Google Colab"/>


### Install dependencies

Add new `code cell`.

To install the necessary libraries, we will use the `pip` package manager. We need to install the following libraries:

    
```python
!pip install chromadb
!pip install langchain
!pip install pymupdf
!pip install cohere
!pip install stability-sdk
```

Click `Run` button or `CMD/CTRL + Enter` to run the single `code cell`. It will take a few minutes to install all the necessary libraries.

Now, if everything is installed correctly, we can move on to the next step.


### Import dependencies

Add new `code cell`.

Here we will import all the necessary libraries, `copy/paste` the following code into the `code cell`.
    
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma  # Chroma vector store
from langchain.embeddings import CohereEmbeddings  # Cohere embeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter  # Recursive character text splitter
from langchain.llms import Cohere  # Cohere LLM
from langchain.chains import VectorDBQA  # VectorDBQA chain
from langchain.document_loaders import PyMuPDFLoader  # PyMuPDF document loaders. Read more: https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
import os
import io
import warnings
from PIL import Image
from stability_sdk import client  # Stability SDK
import stability_sdk.interfaces.gooseai.generation.generation_pb2 as generation
```

Click `Run` button or `CMD/CTRL + Enter` to run the single `code cell`.


### Export environment variables:

Add new `code cell`.

```python

os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"]

os.environ['STABILITY_HOST'] = 'grpc.stability.ai:443'
os.environ["STABILITY_KEY"]

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.


### Part 1 - Getting prompt for Stable Diffusion


Let's quickly upload PDF file to Google Colab. In this tutorial, I go with `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone` book. You can download the PDF file [here](https://www.pdfdrive.com/the-complete-harry-potter-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone-harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-h-d157198854.html). Go to `Files` tab on the left side of the screen, click `Upload to session storage` and upload the PDF file. Wait until the file is uploaded and then `copy` the path to the file.

<Img src="./images/pathToBook.png" alt="Path to uploaded document" caption="Path to uploaded document"/>


Now, let's load the Book.

Add new `code cell`.

```python

loader = PyMuPDFLoader('/content/harry-potter-book-1.pdf')  # Paste the path to the uploaded document
documents = loader.load()

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.


Let's split the document into smaller chunks. Why? We should to make sure that the LLM can process the document. If the document is too long, the LLM will not be able to process it. We will use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the document into smaller chunks. We will split the document into chunks of 1000 characters with 0 overlap.

Add new `code cell`.

```python

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.


Next, we will create a `Chroma` vector store. 

Add new `code cell`.

```python   

embeddings = CohereEmbeddings(cohere_api_key=os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"])  # Create Cohere embeddings
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)  # Create Chroma vector store

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.


Now, we will create a `VectorDBQA` chain.

Add new `code cell`.

```python   

qa = VectorDBQA.from_chain_type(llm=Cohere(cohere_api_key=os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"]), chain_type="stuff", vectorstore=vectordb)  # Create QA chain

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.


Perfect! We have done with `QA` chain. Now, we can query based on the Book. Let's try to ask a question about `Harry Potter`.

Add new `code cell`.

```python   

query = "Can you tell me more about Harry Potter's style, behaviour and character"  # Feel free to change the query to your own
qa.run(query)

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.

<Img src="./images/aboutHarryPotter.png" alt="About Harry Potter" caption="About Harry Potter"/>


### Part 2 - Generating image using Stable Diffusion

Now, we will generate an image using Stable Diffusion. We will use `Stability SDK` to generate an image. Let's create a `Stability SDK` client.

Add new `code cell`.

```python   

# Set up our connection to the API.
stability_api = client.StabilityInference(
    key=os.environ['STABILITY_KEY'], # API Key reference.
    verbose=True, # Print debug messages.
    engine="stable-diffusion-xl-beta-v2-2-2", # Set the engine to use for generation.
    # Available engines: stable-diffusion-v1 stable-diffusion-v1-5 stable-diffusion-512-v2-0 stable-diffusion-768-v2-0
    # stable-diffusion-512-v2-1 stable-diffusion-768-v2-1 stable-diffusion-xl-beta-v2-2-2 stable-inpainting-v1-0 stable-inpainting-512-v2-0
)

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.


Next, paste the prompt you get from the `Chroma` chain.

Add new `code cell`.

```python   
prompt = """

Harry Potter is a boy wizard in training who has to learn how to
perform magic spells, and his character is that of a polite, kind and determined
individual.  Harry is described as being tall and thin, with large glasses and
long, thin, unkempt hair.  He is an extremely polite and friendly person, and
is always willing to help out other people.  Harry is also described as being
determined, and will not give up easily when faced with a challenge.  As he
learns how to perform magic spells, he becomes more confident in his abilities
and his character develops into a more confident and mature person.  Harry is
said to have a kind and caring personality, and is always willing to help out
other people.  Harry is also described as being a brave and determined individual
who will not give up easily when faced with a challenge.  He is described as
being a very intelligent and witty individual who is always willing to help
out other people

"""

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.




Add new `code cell`.

```python   

# Set up our initial generation parameters.
answers = stability_api.generate(
    prompt=prompt, # The prompt to generate from.
    seed=992446758, # If a seed is provided, the resulting generated image will be deterministic.
                    # What this means is that as long as all generation parameters remain the same, you can always recall the same image simply by generating it again.
                    # Note: This isn't quite the case for CLIP Guided generations, which we tackle in the CLIP Guidance documentation.
    steps=30, # Amount of inference steps performed on image generation. Defaults to 30.
    cfg_scale=8.0, # Influences how strongly your generation is guided to match your prompt.
                # Setting this value higher increases the strength in which it tries to match your prompt.
                # Defaults to 7.0 if not specified.
    width=512, # Generation width, defaults to 512 if not included.
    height=512, # Generation height, defaults to 512 if not included.
    samples=1, # Number of images to generate, defaults to 1 if not included.
    sampler=generation.SAMPLER_K_DPMPP_2M # Choose which sampler we want to denoise our generation with.
                                                # Defaults to k_dpmpp_2m if not specified. Clip Guidance only supports ancestral samplers.
                                                # (Available Samplers: ddim, plms, k_euler, k_euler_ancestral, k_heun, k_dpm_2, k_dpm_2_ancestral, k_dpmpp_2s_ancestral, k_lms, k_dpmpp_2m, k_dpmpp_sde)
)


```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.




Add new `code cell`.

```python   

# Set up our warning to print to the console if the adult content classifier is tripped.
# If adult content classifier is not tripped, save generated images.
for resp in answers:
    for artifact in resp.artifacts:
        if artifact.finish_reason == generation.FILTER:
            warnings.warn(
                "Your request activated the API's safety filters and could not be processed."
                "Please modify the prompt and try again.")                  
        if artifact.type == generation.ARTIFACT_IMAGE:
            img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(artifact.binary))
            img_path = img.save(str(artifact.seed)+ ".png") # Save our generated images with their seed number as the filename.


```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.


Let's see the result.

Add new `code cell`.

```python   

# Display the image
img.show()

```

Click `Run` or `CMD/CTRL + Enter`.
