In this guide you will learn how to create SEO header and page title/description for `/apps` sub pages

1. You need to know for what page you are creating the SEO content.

   1. If you are creating for a custom search on `/apps` page for example for chatbot `https://lablab.ai/apps/topic/chatbot`. You need to go into the `app` folder here in.

      1. There you need to create a folder with the name of the search keyword and a file inside called `index.mdx`
      2. There you can define `seoTitle` `seoDescription` `Title` `Description`
      3. You can also add an image to that folder and we will check it and upload it to CDN if we find it OK.

   2. If you are creating for a technology search on `/apps` for example `https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/openai/gpt3` you need to go into the `appTechnology` folder
      1. There you need to create a folder with the technology provider name in our case `openai`
      2. Inside that folder you need to create the technoloy name file `gpt3.mdx`
      3. If it is for the technology provider file name should be `index.mdx`
      4. Easiest way to check the proper names by checking first the url and copying the path
      5. There you can define `seoTitle` `seoDescription` `Title` `Description`
      6. You can also add an image to that folder and we will check it and upload it to CDN if we find it OK.
