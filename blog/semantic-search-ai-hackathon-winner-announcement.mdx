## What a week!

The [Semantic Search Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/semantic-search-hackathon) was a fantastic occasion that inspired creativity and development of 1749 Artificial Intelligence lovers. It was an event that none of the participants will soon forget, with 147 teams on board and an amazing 34 submissions!

It was wonderful to see the participants' passion and creativity come to life in the form of incredible projects and concepts that will push the boundaries of AI even further. The projects showed the promise of AI and how it can be utilized to actually change the world, from the development of natural language processing algorithms to the usage of machine learning and deep learning.

The occasion served as a testament to the enthusiasm for AI that is only growing as more and more individuals are motivated to explore and create using AI technology. The Semantic Search Hackathon was a huge success in displaying the wonderful solutions that can be generated when passion and imagination are united, and it's apparent from the incredible turnout that interest in AI is only growing.

Although the projects that were submitted were of the highest caliber, there could only be one winner. One Honored Mention, one Winner, and two Finalists were the results of the fierce competition. In order to determine which project stood out from the others, the judges from Lablab.ai and Cohere examined the projects using a variety of criteria, such as:



* Degree of Completion Presentation Style Applicability
* Business value Degree of Innovation
* Originality Technology
* Realistic Capability Impact – How unique it is Overall Impression

In the end, the project that not only met every requirement but also gave a thorough and compelling presentation to show the potential of the team's concept in a fresh and new way was the one that won.To differentiate itself from the competition, the presentation had to be able to grab the judges' attention and convince them of the importance of the proposal.

And if you want to watch the whole presentation, [we got you covered](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1705132592).

Main prize goes to the team Found In Translation, for their project [Found in Translation](https://lablab.ai/event/semantic-search-hackathon/ratlabs/f). Read more about the project:

 “Our solution is a smart Slack bot that implements multilingual semantic search and sentiment analysis to facilitate multi-language messaging platforms by improving the chat search function. The bot allows users to search using any language for messages in any language. It also contains a sentiment analysis that gives moderators a sentiment report on the messages of specific users or the chat as a whole.”

Congratulations to the team. And we would like to quote Sandra Kublik, as she announced the winning team, which is a perfect summary of it:

“You guys completely smashed today in terms of ... starting with the name, going to your initial branding, your presentation, the idea, the potential for it, the level of completion, the deployment on slack. Oh my god, what can you guys not do?”

Also during the winner announcement stream you had an opportunity to know more about other to projects to which we would like to shoutout to:



* [Podsearch](https://lablab.ai/event/semantic-search-hackathon/info-insighters/podsearh) - Podcasts are an excellent source of knowledge. But they can be too long and hard to pay attention to the entire time. What if there is a more intuitive way to search for podcasts and also for info within podcasts? This is where our product comes into play. It is possible to scrape the documentation and build an index for a search engine using our architecture easily.
* [SemantoTube](https://lablab.ai/event/semantic-search-hackathon/giga-chads/semantotube) - Our application aims to make it easier for users to find and access the information they need within the specified video. By using the Cohere API, we are able to perform advanced semantic searches that go beyond simple keyword matching, allowing users to find content relevant to their query in the specified video. Our application utilizes the Cohere API to locate and highlight the specific transcript within the video that matches their search. This makes it easier for users to quickly find and access the information they need, without having to manually search through the entire video. 


## Will there be more AI Hackathons to join?
