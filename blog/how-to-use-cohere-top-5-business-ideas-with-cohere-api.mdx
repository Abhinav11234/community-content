It might be difficult to find damaging content in online global networks. Social networking sites and other online communities frequently include a wide range of users who come from many cultures and speak various languages. As a result, it is challenging to detect hazardous content because doing so would require human experts who are proficient in each of these languages.


A multilingual model created by Cohere can [identify dangerous content](https://cohere.ai/use-case-toxic-language) in more than 100 languages. The model is trained using a small number of English examples. These allow it to learn what constitutes objectionable material, which it can then apply to other languages. This enables the rapid and precise detection of hazardous content in online communities around the world, regardless of the language being spoken.
