## Introducing Chirp: Google AI's Cutting-Edge Speech-to-Text Technology

Chirp represents the latest breakthrough in speech-to-text processing, developed by Google AI and integrated into Google Cloud's Speech API. This revolutionary model boasts 2 billion parameters and leverages self-supervised learning from millions of hours of audio and 28 billion text sentences across more than 100 languages. Chirp achieves a remarkable 98% speech recognition accuracy in English and a 300% relative improvement in several languages spoken by less than 10 million people.

## Standout Capabilities

- **Broad Language Support:** Chirp caters to over 100 languages, ensuring top-notch speech recognition for a wide array of languages and accents.
- **Unparalleled Accuracy:** With 98% speech recognition accuracy in English and notable enhancements in other languages, Chirp sets a new industry standard.
- **Massive Model Size:** Chirp's 2-billion-parameter model outpaces previous speech models to deliver superior performance.
- **Innovative Training Approach:** Chirp's encoder is initially trained with an enormous amount of unsupervised (unlabeled) audio data from 100+ languages, followed by fine-tuning for transcription in each specific language using smaller supervised datasets.

## Real-World Applications

Businesses are harnessing the power of Chirp to drive next-gen products and customer experiences in various sectors, such as:

- **HubSpot:** Integrating Chirp into their Conversational Intelligence tools.
- **MRV:** Exploiting the API to reduce customer service time by one-third.
- **Spotify:** Employing Chirp for their voice-activated interface, Car Thing.
- **GDELT Project:** Utilizing Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text and Translation APIs to transcribe and translate global television news, making it searchable and accessible for researchers and journalists.

## Supported Features and Limitations

While Chirp does not support certain Speech-to-Text API functionalities, including confidence scores, speech adaptation, diarization, forced normalization, word-level confidence, and language detection, it does offer:

- Automatic punctuation (predicted by the model and can be disabled)

Chirp is currently accessible in Preview mode within the Speech-to-Text API, with Google planning to refine and extend its reach to more languages and domains in the future.
