Chirp is the next-generation speech-to-text model developed by Google Cloud, bringing the power of large models to Google Cloud's Speech API. Chirp is a 2-billion-parameter speech model trained through self-supervised learning on millions of hours of audio and 28 billion sentences of text spanning over 100 languages. This advanced model delivers 98% speech recognition accuracy in English and a 300% relative improvement in several languages with less than 10 million speakers.

## Key Features

- **Multilingual Support:** Chirp is designed to handle over 100 languages, achieving high-quality speech recognition for more languages and accents.
- **High Accuracy:** Chirp delivers 98% speech recognition accuracy in English and significant improvements in other languages.
- **Large Model Size:** With 2 billion parameters, Chirp is larger than previous speech models, enabling better performance.
- **Self-Supervised Training:** Chirp's encoder is first trained with millions of hours of unsupervised (unlabeled) audio data from 100+ languages and then fine-tuned for transcription in each specific language with small amounts of supervised data.

## Use Cases

Companies are using Chirp to power next-generation products and customer experiences, such as:

- **HubSpot:** Uses Chirp for their Conversational Intelligence tools.
- **MRV:** Leverages the API to reduce customer service time by one-third.
- **Spotify:** Employs Chirp for their voice interface, Car Thing.
- **GDELT Project:** Applies Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text and Translation APIs to transcribe and translate global television news, making it searchable and accessible for researchers and journalists.

## Feature Support and Limitations

Chirp does not support some of the Speech-to-Text API features, including:

- Confidence scores (API returns a value, but it isn't a true confidence score)
- Speech adaptation
- Diarization (automatic diarization and channel separation not supported)
- Forced normalization
- Word-level confidence
- Language detection

Chirp supports the following features:

- Automatic punctuation (predicted by the model and can be disabled)

Chirp is currently available in Preview in the Speech-to-Text API. Google plans to improve and expand Chirp to more languages and domains in the future.
