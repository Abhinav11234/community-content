# Generative AI Studio on Vertex AI

A managed environment in Vertex AI that makes it easy to interact with, tune, and deploy foundation models to production.

## Product highlights

- Google’s foundation models, like PaLM, available as APIs
- Tune foundation models with business data
- Variety of tools for everyone in an organization

## Build, tune, and deploy foundation models with Vertex AI


### Low-code generative AI

Use Google’s multimodal foundation models as APIs including PaLM, Imagen, Codey, and Chirp. Vertex AI's managed endpoints make it easy to build generative capabilities into an application, with only a few lines of code and no ML background required. Developers can forget about the complexities of provisioning storage and compute resources, or of optimizing the model for inference.

### Intuitive user interface

A simple, easy-to-use interface for prompt design, tuning, and deployment makes it easy for developers and data scientists to get started building with generative AI. Users can manually create text inputs, or prompts, that inform a foundation model with a familiar chat-like experience that enables people without developer expertise to interact with a model.

### Flexible tuning options

Generative AI Studio provides a wide range of capabilities including a chat interface, prompt design, prompt tuning, and even the ability to fine-tune model weights. With tools that help both application developers and data scientists contribute to building generative AI, organizations can bring the next generation of applications to production faster, and with more confidence.

### Integration with end-to-end ML tools

Once deployed, foundation models can be scaled, managed, and governed in production using Vertex AI’s end-to-end MLOps capabilities and fully managed AI infrastructure.

### Interact with and tune a variety of foundation models

On Generative AI Studio, you can interact with PaLM 2 for Text and Chat, Imagen for Text-to-Image, Codey for code generation, and Chirp for Speech-to-Text.
