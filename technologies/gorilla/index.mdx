# Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs

Gorilla is a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) designed to understand and accurately invoke over 1,600 APIs by interpreting natural language queries. Its primary aim is to reduce hallucination and offer a user-friendly experience for both developers and non-developers. Gorilla is built by fine-tuning LLaMA weights and harnesses the power of transformer architecture to provide semantically and syntactically correct API calls.

## Key Features

- Accurately invoke 1,600+ APIs using natural language queries
- Reduce hallucination in LLMs
- User-friendly and adaptable to various needs and tools
- Open-source and constantly evolving with community contributions

### Setup and Usage

To get started with Gorilla, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Gorilla GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla) and follow the instructions to set up your local environment.
2. Try Gorilla with the provided [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DEBPsccVLF_aUnmD0FwPeHFrtdC0QIUP?usp=sharing), or run it locally using the instructions in the `inference` folder.
3. Explore the APIBench dataset and evaluation code released by the Gorilla team.
4. Contribute your API to the growing APIZoo, following the [contribution guide](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/tree/main/data/README.md).

### Integration with Other Tools

Gorilla is designed to work seamlessly with other LLM tools, such as Langchain, ToolFormer, and AutoGPT. Its adaptability makes it an ideal candidate for integration into a wide range of applications and toolchains.

### System Requirements

To use Gorilla, you must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of Python will not compile. It is recommended to have a reliable internet connection and sufficient computational resources for optimal performance.
